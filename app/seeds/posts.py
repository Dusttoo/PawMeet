    'Curious to know now that someone has mentioned it can a dog have acid reflux my girl has been sick off and on puking up bile the last few weeks and Friday I took her to the vet where they did an examination over her and said she was probably being picky, Friday night and Saturday she did really good taking her meds and eating the new food they told me to try out for a week. Fast forward to today and she puked up her food that was in her stomach and then puked probably another 5-6 times just acid and bile.',
    'Hi everyone!! So my dogs are Cane Corsos!! I need some opinion on chew toys for them. I just bought them new toys and they already ripped them up!!! So I‚Äôm looking to buy some more toys soon for them, any advice?',
    'Hi all.  This is two posts in one.  I have a very sweet 1 yo lab baby who recently started 1.) coming over to us while we are eating and gently puts his head on my leg and sweetly waits for food to drop/be given to him (which we don‚Äôt do and have never done, so I don‚Äôt know where this came from).  And 2.) alternates between banging on his food bowl and the pantry door when he thinks it‚Äôs time to eat (usually an hour early).  How do I work on curbing these weird (and not bad, but annoying) habits?  Could he need more food?   He definitely is in good shape and doesn‚Äôt need to gain more weight.',
    'Hi everyone! We adopted a 1.5 year old lab mix recently. This is my first dog I have adopted as an adult. The shelter had her for 4 months and it is clear she has had no real training. We were told she loves cats, dogs, kids, and adults. I know it\'s early and to expect a nervous pup until they are well adjusted, but I had a few questions. I don\'t want to do any harm to her gentle demeanor and it is clear she was abused at some point in her life. 1.) Picking up objects and walking towards her scares her(broom, vacuum hose, towel, etc.) She does not react, but looks fearful and I\'m not sure how to reassure her that she is safe in our home and we will do no harm to her. 2.) We live in a 3 story townhome. When myself or my fianc√© come up or down the stairs to the floor she is on she runs and barks in the direction of the noise. Once she realizes it is us she is fine. I understand that she is scared and will take a while to adjust, but I am not sure how to gently curb this behavior. I want to assure her she/we are ok especially if we have friends over so she is not running and barking at them. 3.) My third question is she is supposedly good with all adults however, a male family friend came over last night, he has a beard, and she stood up on our couch barking and growling at him. She is only fearful of men with facial hair. What is the best way to redirect this behavior? Thank you for your advice! We are never going to give up on her and she is staying with us for life. We just need to work out a few little kinks',
    'My dachshund loves to eat toilet paper. We do a pretty good job keeping him out of the bathroom, but once in awhile, I forget and have a tissue in my picket. Any training tips?',
    "Long text, sorry in advanced lol. So if tl:dr basically my friend's small 10-15lbs dog has always growled/snapped at my larger 40-50lbs dog since we got her as a puppy and last night she finally had enough and started to fight back. No injuries, but now I'm worried. What would you do if this was your dog? - -- My friend has 2 tiny dogs(10-15 lbs ish) and I have 2 medium dogs(40-50 lbs). Back when my friend got their first tiny dog as a puppy(male) I already had one of my dogs(also male) and he's incredibly maturnal so he does amazing with puppies and small dogs so they became fast friends. Then they got their second dog (female) and same thing: great friends. But their older dog would growl and snap at their puppy until she got older and he got used to her and now they're fine. Then I got a second puppy(also female) not long after they got their second puppy and the 2 puppies were also fast friends to the point where they play together and it's super cute watching a tiny dog jump up on my bigger dog and she'll lay down for her, etc. But their first dog hates my younger dog from the beginning, just like how he used to treat their puppy. So every time we get together with our dogs their older dog is growling at my younger dog and snapped at her a few times, especially over toys/bones/etc. They just said oh yeah, he's really possessive but our puppy will take things right out of his mouth and he doesn't do anything about it so it's fine ü§®. I thought okay... As long as it's just all growl and no bite I guess? Then 2 visits ago in my house he really went after my younger dog after his owner threw a ball ( and they both ran to get the ball) to the point where the owner had to go pick him up so he would stop and my younger dog didn't do anything back so we said okay, no fetch around these dogs then and put the toys away and back to the regular growling. So last night they were over at my house again and their dog was growling at my younger dog again (she's just over a year now so not exactly a puppy anymore) but whatever, we're all used to it now. Until she brought one of her bones into the room and he went after her just like the time before and this time she responded: snarling, baring teeth, and looked like she was ready to fight him if he didn't back down but I knew he wouldn't back down so it was like this air fight between them but no actual contact (yet) so I pulled my dog away and we went into another room and closed  the door to calm down ( and meanwhile my friend put the bone into a different room so no one could get to it). And I thought... This is bad. This is getting worse and I can't have my dog injuring/killing a tiny dog since his entire head can fit in her mouth! And what if this causes my dog to suddenly think she needs to fight other dogs over her stuff? So I put a muzzle on her, which she's not used to and I did not train her in it properly (my older dog was trained on a muzzle so I could take him on the bus requirement in my area and so I could take him to my friend's farm that had chickens just in case. But my younger dog I never needed to and kinda forgot that it might be a thing we needed to do in the future so that's my bad) so my dog was pawing at the muzzle and visibly uncomfortable. But I thought... These people aren't going to watch/stop their dog unless I make a point. It worked: they told their dog to stop every time he growled and picked him up if he didn't stop growling then told me I could take the muzzle off of her and they would stop their dog. So our younger dogs got to play together without their other dog intervening. This entire time my older dog is in the other side of the room laying down with his ears back like \"I'm not getting involved in this BS\" lol, it must have made him feel pretty torn watching his 2 good friends fight. So now that we've gotten this far in the story lol... Wtf do I do now?? These people were my older dog's babysitter for years, and we babysit their dogs too, and if one of us is out late the other can drop into their house to tend to the dogs. It's a great set up we have going with them and they're only 5-10 minutes drive from us. We do have another friend who has a puppy that could mind our dogs too, but he lives in an apartment so not as much space as these friends plus he lives in a more city area with no private yard so he would have to walk 3 dogs to go potty/etc üò¨. And it's further for us to drive to(45 minutes, longer if traffic). So I guess I'm asking for any advice dealing with my dog, dealing  with their dog, dealing with my friend... Or any similar situations you've been in so I don't feel alone. I feel bad because my dog is such a good dog and I let her get pushed too far but she clearly has a limit and I failed her by letting that happen... I don't want her to think she needs to fight other dogs or anything like that. I don't know what to do or what to think now. ",
    "Good morning! I have heard a lot about yak chews. I was wondering what everyone‚Äôs experience with them was. I hear they aren‚Äôt smelly but are they messy?  Do they leave a residue on the floor/carpet?  I have a 97 lb border collie GSD mix who LOVES to chew and absolutely destroys toys. Our local pet store stopped carrying his favorite large chew which was made my a local company - it was a ‚Äúbeef cheek rolll‚Äù. ü§¢ Smelled gross but he loved it.  Anything else I can find is half the size & he will eat & try to swallow & choke on it in 10 minutes. I can‚Äôt find anything that lasts for him. Any suggestions would be great!",
    "My dogs both walk amazingly well alone - separate on walks (when I take one at a time) but whenever I try take both of them for a walk (I walk one my partner/ or friend walks the other) my younger boy goes crazy, he pulls, tries to run and he is a big boy so it‚Äôs hard to walk them together but I know I can help make it easier for us? On walks alone he is a dream to walk, he doesn‚Äôt pull, listens very well, sits at roads and everything (I did a lot of walk training since he was 8 weeks but not so often with both dogs together, he is now 12 months old and it‚Äôs never really gotten easier to walk both dogs together. Help? I think my younger boy just wants to ‚Äòlead‚Äô / be infront of our older dog ? üòÖ",
    "Ok help this isn‚Äôt much of a training question but I figured it‚Äôs related I have 2 gates and my 3 chihuahuas can walk right through these if I‚Äôm not watching them they get out‚Ä¶. Any ideas on fixing the problem It‚Äôs the gate the are squeezing past a new fence is out of the question as I have almost an acre My fence is not broken my dogs are literally 2lbs üôÉ",
    "Looking for any advice My 11 month old male Neo has had 3 surgeries in 6 months and therefore has not gotten proper training/socializing during that time. I have 3 other dogs and trying to re-introduce him into the pack has been a nightmare. He has hurt 1 of my dogs by jumping on their back(playfully?) And caused a huge fight between him and 2 others when he tried bullying the alpha female. He also chews on anything wood and can't be left unsupervised for even 2 minutes. He will put down a raw meaty bone to chew wood baseboards üôÑ I live alone and work full time. Even if there were trainers in my area they either aren't affordable or aren't available for my schedule. I have resorted to keeping my neo separate from my other 3 dogs but this means he spends alot of time in a kennel because I can't devote as much time to JUST HIM. Shuffling dogs around for feedings and outings and all the baby gates and crate time is miserable and exhausting and time consuming and very impractical for long term. I need advice on ways to manage 4 dogs who don't get along and how to get a 135lb PUPPY to respect those smaller than him and eventually be able to be part of the pack without causing fights.",
    "Looking for suggestions for our Skip, in particular interacting with my husband. I have posted before, but we adopted a male chihuahua in March who was 14 mo. at the time. He was rescued from an animal hoarding situation and knew he had a huge fear of being caught. But we don‚Äôt know about particulars of trama he may have experienced, so is just a guess. He has a naturally super loving personality, now asks for pets and rubs(huge milestone when that happenedü•∞), has always been so fun and playful and energetic, is very food driven, is doing well on a leash, is very smart and extremely observant, just an all round fun dog to have! He has come SO far, and we are so incredibly proud of him! We have used a whole lot of positive reinforcement and let time work. I am the primary care taker of our dogs, I feed almost always and take out to play and walk. My husband is around a lot though and plays and interacts with them lovingly. Our two females are definitely ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs girls‚Äù. I have heard that that can often be the case, females going to men, males to women. I know that Skip has definitely bonded with me but also noticed that he bonded with my oldest daughter very quickly(she is around a lot), but also noticed that he took to my younger daughter just after a couple visits a few weeks apart.  I feel is is absolutely safe to say that he takes to women and men are very intimidating to him and idk if it‚Äôs just his personality/preference or if he was mistreated by a man/men? The positive news is that of any man, Skip does interact willingly with my husband. The biggest thing that happened was when he pawed my husbands hand in bed and asked for rubs, but only at a full arm length away. He will run to see him when there is food around(not a great habit) and will take treats from him. He will also ‚Äúbop‚Äù his hand with his nose and be happy jump and wag his tail. And a few times when I am not in the room, when the other two dogs have been laying with my husband in his chair, he has laid with him, but out of reach. Anyway, sorry to ramble, I guess I‚Äôm just trying to say that my husband would love and try‚Äôs daily to improve their relationship, you can tell Skip wants a closer relationship he will even bark with frustration seeing the girls get affection and he wants it, but is to scared to get close enough. His fears get to him and is harder for him to over come them with my husband, than with me, I feel it‚Äôs simply because he is a man. Question, do I just keep doing what we are doing, continue to make contact a very positive and rewarding experience and just let time tell, or is there anything else that can help him learn that men don‚Äôt have to be feared, especially his human daddy. Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è"
    "Hello, I have a 7 month old Golden Retriever. He has a stubborn streak. If he is outside and doesn‚Äôt want to move, he lays down. If he doesn‚Äôt want to come, he doesn‚Äôt. Months ago he obeyed recall commands. I know this is the age they get more independent-or the adolescent phase. I don‚Äôt want to mess this up though as this won‚Äôt be so cute when he is 85 pounds. What can I do to communicate with him that the stubbornness is not in his best interest?"

And a couple of water sprays since he feared those so much. Everytime he started a fight with another dog I sprayed the hell out of him and he'd retreat.

If they become too focused on each other I‚Äôd break it and just keep walking, then repeat with the other one. It‚Äôs best to introduce one at a time so the whole pack doesn‚Äôt gang up on one dog‚Äîbut also important that you introduce calmly.

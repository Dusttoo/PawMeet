## Paw Meet at a glance:
Paw Meet is a full stack web application where users can explore many different dog breeds. Users are also able to join in on conversations on the forum and take a quiz to find the breed the best fits their lifestyle.

I was able to implement a custom scoring algorithm that compared breed traits to a user quiz to find the best dog breed match in order to improve the interactivity of my application, as well as image uploading to create a more intuitive interface for uploading images.
